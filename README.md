# First App Template
## Use this as a template to begin your React Apps 😁

Using **create-react-app**, but removing some files witch maybe you does not need for begin your projet. Also added the devDependencies in `package.json` because **create-react-app** lacks this.

### Prerequisites
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Use
You just need to use this template, then in your console:

```
    yarn install
```

Wait for the installation and then you can begin to `code`!
